Github APIs( or Github ReST APIs) are the APIs that you can use to interact with GitHub. 
They allow you to create and manage repositories, branches, issues, pull requests, and many more. For fetching 
publicly available information (like public repositories, user profiles, etc.), you can call the API.

Mascot
GitHub's mascot is an anthropomorphized "octocat" with five octopus-like arms.[54][55] The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock,[56] a website that enables designers to market royalty-free digital images. GitHub became interested in Oxley's work after Twitter selected a bird that he designed for their own logo.[57] The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss.[56] Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image.[56]

GitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat,[56] and trademarked the character along with the new name.[54] Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character, which are available on The Octodex
