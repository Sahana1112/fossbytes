Organizational structure
GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).[48] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive.[49][needs update]

In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management.[50]

Finance
GitHub.com was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[51] In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital.[3] In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million of venture capital in a series B round. Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and other venture capital funds.[52] As of August 2016, GitHub was making $140 million in Annual Recurring Revenue.[
